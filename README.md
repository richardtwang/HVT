# HVT
My project concerning the Habitual Voter Theorem. Voter data supplied by the [North Carolina State Board of Elections](https://dl.ncsbe.gov/index.html?prefix=data/). US Census data provided by the [United States Census Bureau](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). Completed June 2017.

- The **census folder** contains census data matched by zip codes for each ncid (voter).
- The **voter_data** folder contains cleaned .xlsx files (100 total) containing voting information for all registered voters of North Carolina.
- The **Interactive Model** folder contains a macro-enabled .xlsx file representing the logistic regression output through a user interface (UI). Instructions for the UI can be found in the Appendix [at](richardwang.org).
- The R code used to run the regression model is located in the **voter_code.R** file.
